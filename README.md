# youtube-installer
youtube-installer.py can download a youtube video using its url it can also download multiple videos by only seperating the links with a comma.
the only probleme with this programme is that it can't download age restricted video because it requires login.

i'm learning selenium so i'll try to fix this probleme if i didn't forget to.

Pytube is a popular Python library for downloading videos from YouTube. However, due to YouTube's terms of service and API restrictions, it is not recommended to use Pytube or any other similar library to download videos from YouTube, especially if you are trying to bypass age restrictions or violate copyright laws.


Note 1 :you should install pytube and movie.py libraries.  
type this in the python's terminal(one for each time) : 
pip install pytube                                      
pip install movie.py
